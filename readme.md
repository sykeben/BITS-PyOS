## BITS-PyOS
### BIOS-Implementation-Test-Suite-based Python Operating System

**Be warned!** This is a hodge-podge of BITS, SysLinux, and my own code.  

This is an Operating System based on Intel's open-source BIOS Implementation Test Suite, or BITS. BITS is a bare metal Python intepreter made for testing hardware, firmware, etc. It uses SysLinux to boot, and run my own python code as the UI.
