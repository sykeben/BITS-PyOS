## Beta Windows Tools

These are beta windows tools for building, updating, etc. BITS-PyOS.

### IMPORTANT WARNING
MAKE SURE TO START EACH TOOL INSIDE OF THE `wintools-beta` DIRECTORY! THESE TOOLS ARE VERY DEPENDANT ON THEIR DIRECTORY PLACEMENT!

### Included Tools
- `make_disk.bat`: Builds and flashes BITS-PyOS to a disk.
- `make_disk (backup).bat`: Copy of `make_disk.bat`, just in case your AV deletes it due to the elevation methods.
- `update_pycode.bat`: Updated the PyOS PyCode, if you have modified it in the repo.
